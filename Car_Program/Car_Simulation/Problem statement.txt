The expected goals in the approach of this evaluation-work are the following:
Independance Independant approach solving easy tasks (research possible if required).
Polymorphie Use polymorphie if possible.
c++ standards Use at least one feature since c++11.
Tracing The requirement id’s like REQ_ID_1 are to be mapped to the source code inside a
comment.

Task
To simplify this task, the following requirements and explainations are not correct physics.
4.1 Build environment
A environment to compile and run the source code have to be created. A simple CMakeLists.txt
file is sufficient. Building can be done via Console, any additional tooling / editors are allowed
if cmake is used.
4.2 Requirements
Three cars have to be simulated regarding fuel consumption.
4.2.1 REQ_ID_1
Fuel consumption is calculated as the following formular:
fuel (distance) = distance * roll_resistance + distance * wind_resistance, with the distance
given in meters.
4.2.2 Similarities
4.2.2.1 REQ_ID_2
Roll resistance is calculated with a factor of 0,75 multiplied with the weight in kg of the vehicle.
4.2.2.2 REQ_ID_3
Wind resistance is calculated with a factor of 0,2 multiplied with the car height in meters.
4.2.3 Convertable car
4.2.3.1 REQ_CAR_4
The convertable car has a height of 1.5 meters.
4.2.3.2 REQ_CAR_5
The convertable car has a weight of 500kg.
4.2.4 Van
4.2.4.1 REQ_VAN_6
The van has a height of 1,5 meters.
4.2.4.2 REQ_VAN_7
The van has a weight of 4.000kg.
4.2.5 Truck
4.2.5.1 REQ_TRUCK_8
The truck has a height of 4 meters.
4.2.5.2 REQ_TRUCK_9
The truck as a weight of 5.000kg.
4.2.5.3 REQ_TRUCK_10
The truck is capable of attaching an trailer.
4.2.5.4 REQ_TRUCK_11
The empty trailer weights 500kg.
4.2.6 REQ_TRUCK_12
The full trailer weights 30.000kg.
4.2.7 REQ_TRUCK_13
The trailer_resistance is calculated with a factor of 0,05 multiplied with the trailer weight in kg.
4.2.7.1 REQ_TRUCK_14
With an attachted trailer the fuel consumption formular is:
fuel (distance) = distance * roll_resistance + distance * wind_resistance + distance * trailer_-
resistance
4.3 Execute
Run the compiled program and print the result for a distance of 42.195 km.
